Amid rising inflation and economic challenges, middle- and lower-income households in Germany are facing increasing difficulties in managing grocery expenses. Our application addresses this issue by enabling users to identify the most cost-effective yet high-quality grocery options. By aggregating and comparing prices across leading supermarkets in Germany, the app ensures that consumers can access the best deals without compromising on quality, thereby optimizing their purchasing decisions and reducing overall grocery costs.

Beyond price comparison, the app incorporates advanced price prediction capabilities. Utilizing historical data and sophisticated forecasting models, it provides insights into future price trends for various grocery items. This allows users to plan their purchases strategically, fostering smarter shopping habits and mitigating the financial impact of inflation.

Additionally, the app includes an expense tracking feature to support effective financial management, helping users monitor and control their grocery expenditures efficiently. Our mission is to enhance price transparency, empower informed financial decision-making, and promote sustainable shopping practices, ultimately providing meaningful relief to consumers in a challenging economic landscape.

The data points that are only used to train the model have been sourced from https://rewe.nicoo.org. Apart from this, every other database belongs to us.
